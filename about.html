            I am a newly graduated web developer and earned my certificate from Emory University, and Fullstack Academy. Things that interest me are music, movies, tech, cars, and people! I am big on being family oriented and have spent a lot of time building the firm relationships I have with my family members. I discovered coding a couple of months before starting at Emory and Fullstack with CodeAcademy and fell in love with how much detail and critical thinking went into Python and Javascript. Ever since then I have been hooked and have not looked back since.
