            <p style="color:white;"> Creating a cookie clicker game with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is a multi-step process. Here's an overview of the steps I took to create a basic cookie clicker game:
                I created an HTML file with a button that links to my JavaScript file and an element to display the number of cookies the user has baked.
                In a separate JavaScript file,  I created  a variable to store the number of cookies the user has baked and a function to increment the variable by 1 each time the button is clicked.
                I then created a JavaScript function to update the number of cookies displayed on the page each time the button is clicked.
                and added more features like upgrades, achievements, and more to make the game more interesting. <a href="https://github.com/daleh22/click_game/blob/master/script.js" >link to github repo</a> <a href="https://dynamic-starlight-c07bb0.netlify.app/">link to game</a>

            <p style="color:white;"> To create a Tic Tac Toe game in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that allows you to play against the computer, I took the following steps:
                I started by creating the basic structure of the game in HTML. I created a 3x3 grid of div elements to represent the Tic Tac Toe board. I also added a button that allows the player to start a new game.
                Using CSS, I styled the Tic Tac Toe board and the button to make the game look more visually appealing.
                In JavaScript, I created variables to keep track of the game state, such as the player's turn, the board state, and the game outcome. I also wrote functions to handle the logic of the game, such as checking for a winner, making a move, and starting a new game.
                To make the computer play against the player, I used the minimax algorithm which is a common algorithm used in game AI to determine the best move for the computer player. The algorithm evaluates all possible game states and calculates the best move for the computer player.
                I added an event listener to the button to start a new game and to the div elements of the grid to handle the player's move and the computer's move.
                Finally, I added some logic to handle the end of the game, such as displaying a message to the player indicating whether they won, lost, or tied the game.

            <p style="color:white;"> For this project I created a website that would allow users to log in and view a series of posts made by other users. I did this using REACTJS, HTML, and css.
                we used an external API to feed the website posts from other users and would add to that API if you wanted to post a message.
